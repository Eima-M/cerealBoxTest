# cerealBoxTest

Here are two of my personal projects I was working on during my internship placement at OutOfTheBit Ltd.
This indie game development company makes use of a custom engine in C created by the director and lead developer, Ali Motisi.
The two test projects as seen were built within this game engine.
My goal is to rebuild and complete the development of 'test2' using the SDL library.
